				My name is Leonardo, and I am a passionate web developer with a
				love for building amazing applications. I thrive on solving
				complex problems with elegant and creative solutions. ðŸš€ Outside
				of coding, you will often find me leveling up in my favorite
				video games ðŸŽ® or working on my gains at the gym ðŸ’ª. I believe
				in balancing a curious mind with a healthy body, and I am always
				up for a new challengeâ€”whether it is mastering a tricky
				algorithm or smashing a new personal record!
